# critical-period-ear-growth
Data and code for non-linear mixed effect model analysis of maize ear growth during the critical period. Research was conduct at Purdue University in 2016 and 2017 and was submitted for publication in 2019.

Key for `Critical Period Ear Sampling Data.csv` <br>
Year – year data was collected <br>
Plot – unique plot identifier within year <br>
Block – block number (experiment was split-plot, randomized complete block design) <br>
YOR – Year of Release. Year the hybrid became commercially available. YOR is unique for each hybrid used in the experiment <br>
Nlevel – nitrogen fertilizer (N) treatment. <br>
* 0 – no N applied <br>
* 1-	200 lbs N applied at V4 <br>
* 2-	150 lbs N applied at V4 plus 50 lbs of N applied at R1 <br>
* 3-	50 lbs N applied at V4 plus 150 lbs of N applied at R1 <br>
* 4-	200 lbs N applied at R1 <br>

Time – sampling date with 1 being the first and 5 being the last <br>
EarDw – dry weight (g/plant) <br>
EarNper – ear nitrogen concentration <br>
EarNmg – ear nitrogen content (mg/plant) <br>
GDD – sampling date scaled to thermal time <br>
yr_block – unique identifier of year * block combinations <br>
